This repository contains R and Octave/Matlab code for a risk computational model that calculates the willingness to pay for a new technology 
such that even a risk averse farmer would find it optimal based on second order stochastic dominance (SOSD). 
It implements an approach in Hurley et al (2018). We have developed code that allows one to run octave within R and seamlessly use the datasets and functions across the two software. The notebook and embedded R & octave code can be accessed here: <a href="https://eia2030-ex-ante.github.io/WTP_Bounds_SOSD_Risk_Model/" target="_blank"> Risk Optimization Model</a>
